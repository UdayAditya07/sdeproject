  <div class="tro"><p class="start"> We all had many expectations before coming to the college about our studies,extra curricular activites,campus,friends,faculty etc etc..... Below are some of my expections on college and reality I got to know......</p></div>
  <hr>
  <h2>Expectation</h2>
  <img class="campus" src="https://visit.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2020/03/Engineering-Building-II.jpg" alt="campus">
  <p class="expectation-1">I expected the campus to be very big and spacious with great infrastructure as well as beautiful and attractive. And a complete greenery around it...... And own campus as well..... </p>
  
  <br>
  <h2 class="sub">Reality</h2>
  
  <img class="academic" src="academic building.jpg" alt="building">
  <p class="reality-1">Small campus and not very attractive. It's not even our own campus it is rented from JUT... The infrastructure is also average..... But overall it is good....</p>
  <hr class="style">
  
  <h2>Expectation</h2>
  
  <img class="Hostel"src="https://content.jdmagicbox.com/comp/warangal/k9/9999px870.x870.190823172624.b5k9/catalogue/r-r-boys-hostel-warangal-0rd03xzutm-250.jpg" alt="hostel">
  <p class="expectation-2">I expected the hostel to be congested,overcrowded and like in movies and most of the hostels I thought there will be a single bathroom for all of them..... </p>
  
  <h2 class="sub-1">Reality</h2>
  
  <img class="hostel" src="hostel.jpg" alt="Hostel">
  <p class="reality-2">To my surprise the hostel is very nice and spacious and there reasonable number of students in one flat and there are 3 bathrooms for 8 people which is quite impressive may be I can say that these hostels are one of the best among all the hostels but still it is rented..... Hoping that when we get our own hostel may it we similar to these hostels finger's crossed....</p>
  <hr class="style">

  <h2>Expectation</h2>
  
  <img class="kichidi" src="kichidi.jpg" alt="kichidi">
  <p class="expectation-3">I expected that hostel food would taste very bad and low quality of ingredients will be used making it more worse..... And not serving food more than once and same menu everyday making the food very boring...... </p>
  
  <h2 class="sub">Reality</h2>
  
 <img class="mess-party" src="mess party.jpg" alt="food">
  <p class="reality-3">The mess food here quite good then what I expected we even have mess secerectary, treasurer and members who take care the needs of the students their problems in mess food and they take feedback whether they are comfortable with the food served. The thing I liked the most was since I am from south I have habit of eating rasam so the member arranged it even though the cook doesn't know how to cook. Overall the food is good.......</p>

  <h2>Expectation</h2>
  
  <img class="party" src="https://blog.zolostays.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/shutterstock_351380480-min.png" alt="party">
  <p class="expectation-4">I expected there will be big events and lot of fun happening in  big space and every event is celebrated in that way as big as possible many events........... </p>
  
  <h2 class="sub">Reality</h2>
  
  <img class="event" src="event.jpg" alt="IIIT Ranchi Event">
  <p class="reality-4"> The events are small and takes place in small ground in JUMPI campus it was same like students performing at a school function but we enjoyed a lot.......  </p>
  <hr class="style">
  
  <h2>Expectation</h2>
  
  <img class="enjoy" src="https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/trendy-friends-having-fun-hostel-party-night-happy-travel-people-enjoying-time-together-playing-music-friendship-nightlife-170722588.jpg" alt="enjoying at night">
  <p class="expectation-5">I expected to enjoy a lot in the night with webseries,movies with friends, late night talks, having a blast in the room at mid night, dancing and singing basically having fun....... </p>
 
  <h2 class="sub">Reality</h2>
  
  <img class="us" src="pic.jpg" alt="us studying">
  <p class="reality-5"> But we get assignments to complete and submit it before the deadline which keeps us awake in the night so instead of enjoying we only study.......</p>
  <hr class="style">
  
  <h2>Expectation</h2>
  
  <img class="differences" src="https://blog.edmentum.com/sites/blog.edmentum.com/files/styles/blog_image/public/images/AC009-1471%20Kindergarden%20vs%205th%20Grade.png?itok=c72qb0BY" alt="diferences">
  <p class="expectation-6">Being from south India my first expectation in this college was the north south barrier that would limit me to only south indians which would deny my interaction with north students....</p>
  
  <h2 class="sub">Reality</h2>

  <img class="us-1"src="us again.jpg" alt="we">
  <p class="reality-6">Now after coming to the college the doubt completely vanished.... Because I met these idiots of mine..... There is no north south barrier which is awesome.......</p>
